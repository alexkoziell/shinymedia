# shinymedia

This package provides Shiny UI components relating to audio and video. It currently provides the following two components:

- `input_video_clip()`: A video input component that allows the user to record a short audio/video clip from a webcam, and sends it as a reactive input value.
- `audio_spinner()`: An output component that plays an audio clip while displaying a spinning visualization that pulses in sync with the audio.

## Installation

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/jcheng5/shinymedia
```
